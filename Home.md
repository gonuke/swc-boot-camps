# Preparing for a Boot Camp

1.  [[Clone/fork your own copy of the boot-camp repo|Workflow]].

2.  Update the `README.md` of your boot-camp repo to reflect your
    boot camp's time/date/location.

3.  Optionally build a new web page for your boot camp

    1. [[Small sites can go directly in the gh-pages
       repository|Boot-Camp-Pages]].

    2. [[Larger sites can be integrated using
       submodules|Stand-Alone-Boot-Camp-Sites]].

4. Make and publish futher alterations to your boot camp branch as you
   see fit.  See the [[notes on the suggested Git workflow|Workflow]]
   for hints.
