# When should we test?

Short answers:

-   **ALWAYS!**
-   **EARLY!**
-   **OFTEN!**

Long answers:

* Definitely before you do something important with your software
  (e.g. publishing data generated by your program, launching a
  satellite that depends on your software, â€¦).
* Before and after adding something new, to avoid accidental breakage.
* To help remember ([TDD][]: define) what your code actually does.

# Who should test?

* Write tests for the stuff you code, to convince your collaborators
  that it works.
* Write tests for the stuff others code, to convince yourself that it
  works (and will continue to work).

Professionals often test their code, and take pride in test coverage,
the percent of their functions that they feel confident are
comprehensively tested.

# How are tests written?

The type of tests that are written is determined by the testing
framework you adopt. Don't worry, there are a lot of choices.

## Types of Tests

**Exceptions:** Exceptions can be thought of as type of runtime test.
They alert the user to exceptional behavior in the code. Often,
exceptions are related to functions that depend on input that is unknown
at compile time. Checks that occur within the code to handle exceptional
behavior that results from this type of input are called Exceptions.

**Unit Tests:** Unit tests are a type of test which test the fundamental
units of a program's functionality. Often, this is on the class or
function level of detail. However what defines a *code unit* is not
formally defined.

To test functions and classes, the interfaces (API) - rather than the
implementation - should be tested. Treating the implementation as a
black box, we can probe the expected behavior with boundary cases for
the inputs.

**System Tests:** System level tests are intended to test the code as a
whole. As opposed to unit tests, system tests ask for the behavior as a
whole. This sort of testing involves comparison with other validated
codes, analytical solutions, etc.

**Regression Tests:** A regression test ensures that new code does
change anything. If you change the default answer, for example, or add a
new question, you'll need to make sure that missing entries are still
found and fixed.

**Integration Tests:** Integration tests query the ability of the code
to integrate well with the system configuration and third party
libraries and modules. This type of test is essential for codes that
depend on libraries which might be updated independently of your code or
when your code might be used by a number of users who may have various
versions of libraries.

**Test Suites:** Putting a series of unit tests into a collection of
modules creates, a test suite. Typically the suite as a whole is
executed (rather than each test individually) when verifying that the
code base still functions after changes have been made.

# Elements of a Test

**Behavior:** The behavior you want to test. For example, you might want
to test the fun() function.

**Expected Result:** This might be a single number, a range of numbers,
a new fully defined object, a system state, an exception, etc. When we
run the fun() function, we expect to generate some fun. If we don't
generate any fun, the fun() function should fail its test.
Alternatively, if it does create some fun, the fun() function should
pass this test. The the expected result should known *a priori*. For
numerical functions, this is result is ideally analytically determined
even if the function being tested isn't.

**Assertions:** Require that some conditional be true. If the
conditional is false, the test fails.

**Fixtures:** Sometimes you have to do some legwork to create the
objects that are necessary to run one or many tests. These objects are
called fixtures as they are not really part of the test themselves but
rather involve getting the computer into the appropriate state.

For example, since fun varies a lot between people, the fun() function
is a method of the Person class. In order to check the fun function,
then, we need to create an appropriate Person object on which to run
fun().

**Setup and teardown:** Creating fixtures is often done in a call to a
setup function. Deleting them and other cleanup is done in a teardown
function.

**The Big Picture:** Putting all this together, the testing algorithm is
often:

```python
setup()
test()
teardown()
```

But, sometimes it's the case that your tests change the fixtures. If so,
it's better for the setup() and teardown() functions to occur on either
side of each test. In that case, the testing algorithm should be:

```python
setup()
test1()
teardown()

setup()
test2()
teardown()

setup()
test3()
teardown()
```

# Nose: A Python Testing Framework

The testing framework we'll discuss today is called nose. However, there
are several other testing frameworks available in most language. Most
notably there is [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/) in Java which can
arguably attributed to inventing the testing framework.

## Where do nose tests live?

Nose tests are files that begin with `Test-`, `Test_`, `test-`, or
`test_`. Specifically, these satisfy the testMatch regular expression
`[Tt]est[-_]`. (You can also teach nose to find tests by declaring them
in the unittest.TestCase subclasses chat you create in your code. You
can also create test functions which are not unittest.TestCase
subclasses if they are named with the configured testMatch regular
expression.)

## Nose Test Syntax

To write a nose test, we make assertions.

```python
assert should_be_true()
assert not should_not_be_true()
```

Additionally, nose itself defines number of assert functions which can
be used to test more specific aspects of the code base.

```python
from nose.tools import *

assert_equal(a, b)
assert_almost_equal(a, b)
assert_true(a)
assert_false(a)
assert_raises(exception, func, *args, **kwargs)
assert_is_instance(a, b)
# and many more!
```

Moreover, numpy offers similar testing functions for arrays:

```python
from numpy.testing import *

assert_array_equal(a, b)
assert_array_almost_equal(a, b)
# etc.
```

## Exercise: Writing tests for mean()

There are a few tests for the mean() function that we listed in this
lesson. What are some tests that should fail? Add at least three test
cases to this set. Edit the `test_mean.py` file which tests the mean()
function in `mean.py`.

*Hint:* Think about what form your input could take and what you should
do to handle it. Also, think about the type of the elements in the list.
What should be done if you pass a list of integers? What if you pass a
list of strings?

**Example**:

    nosetests test_mean.py

# Test Driven Development

Test driven development (TDD) is a philosophy whereby the developer
creates code by **writing the tests first**. That is to say you write the
tests *before* writing the associated code!

This is an iterative process whereby you write a test then write the
minimum amount code to make the test pass. If a new feature is needed,
another test is written and the code is expanded to meet this new use
case. This continues until the code does what is needed.

TDD operates on the YAGNI principle (You Ain't Gonna Need It). People
who diligently follow TDD swear by its effectiveness. This development
style was put forth most strongly by [Kent Beck in
2002](http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-By-Example/dp/0321146530).

For an example of TDD, see [the Fibonacci example][fibonacci].

# Quality Assurance Exercise

Can you think of other tests to make for the fibonacci function? I promise there 
are at least two. 

Implement one new test in test_fib.py, run nosetests, and if it fails, implement 
a more robust function for that case.

And thus - finally - we have a robust function together with working
tests!
