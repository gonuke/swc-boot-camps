Creating a new workshop
=======================

There is a central repository for all workshops.

  https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop

The âmasterâ branch has the current state-of-the-art source for the
instructors' projected content, handouts, workshop homepage, etc.
Different "editions" of material can live side-by-side in subdirectories.

Topics will live in per-subject subdirectories, ideally organized in
half-day-sized chunks.

  tip.  Sections should be in half-day-ish chunks.  Complicated topics
  that need more detailed coverage (e.g. version control) can have
  nested sub-sections.

An instructor preparing for a new workshop should create a
new, empty repository on the SWC GitHub organization. Material can be
added to this repositry either by merging from the central repo or simply
copying in any material.

Developing workshop content
===========================

If you don't have strong ideas about the content, there's probably not
much to do here besides tweaking a few workshop-specific bits
(location, dates, master-index, â¦).  These changes should go into the
workshop repository.

If you plan to make significant (but not workshop specific)
changes to workshop material you should
make those changes in your personal fork of the central repository. That way
it's easy to ask for those changes to be included in the central repo via
a pull request.

Publishing workshop websites
============================

This is not really part of the workshop-branch vs. workshop-repo
discussion, but one benefit to the workshop-repo approach is that each
workshop may have a gh-pages website at

  http://<user>.github.com/<repo>
  http://swcarpentry.github.com/2012-12-my-workshop

Post-workshop archival
======================

The workshop repositories are already on the SWC GitHub page, so
there's nothing to do here.
