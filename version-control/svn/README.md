In addition to the generic version control objectives and points.

Basic use
=========

Learning objectives
-------------------

* Explain why working copies of different projects should not overlap.

Key points
----------

* The master copy is stored in a repository.
* Nobody ever edits the master directory: instead, each person edits a
  local working copy.
* The basic workflow for version control is update-change-commit.

Merging conflicts
=================

Learning objectives
-------------------

* Identify the auxiliary files created when a conflict occurs.

Key points
----------

* For each conflicted file, Subversion creates auxiliary files
  containing the common parent, the master version, and the local
  version.
