Here are some arguments for side B (multiple repo option) mixed
together with arguments against side A. I use the => characters to
indicate what I think is the likely outcome of some of the points.

* One repo per bootcamp is the simplest possible construction. There
  is no coupling to people that aren't instructors at that
  bootcamp. The simplest possible construction reduces the
  instructors' cognitive load so they can focus on execution.
* Every instructor will have idiosyncrasies regarding their teaching
  style. => Even if there is a common starting point, notes will
  likely diverge.
* There won't be 100% consensus on format. => Even if there is a
  majority, some people will refuse to teach with, for example, slide
  decks. Thus they will be alienated and feel less enthusiastic about
  helping with future bootcamps.
* Maintaining "official" ports of multiple formats will require lots
  of additional administrative overhead. => Resources will be spent on
  the administrative overhead even though they may be better spent
  elsewhere.
* Air-traffic controlling all this material will require
  administrative overhead.  => Resources will be spent on the
  administrative overhead even though they may be better spent
  elsewhere.
* Having a system with a lot of administrative overhead increases its
  brittleness. If the admins disappear for whatever reason, merges to
  the repo may become unstable since no one would be maintaining them.
* Complexity is the enemy of execution. => Eventually the single
  repo/multiple branch model will torpedo a bootcamp.
* The coupling of instructors at a bootcamp and likely a
  non-instructor merging pull requests into the same repo will have
  negative unintended consequences. => Eventually this coupling will
  torpedo a bootcamp.
* Bootcamp notes will soon cross a threshold of pedagogical value and
  reach a point of diminishing returns. At that point time should be
  spent on improving the performance part of the lecture rather than
  the notes. Additional modification to the notes only increase the
  complexity of the repo and threaten the execution of the bootcamp as
  described above.

Let me reiterate that I don't think the multiple repos model is a
great option, but I think it is the least worst.
